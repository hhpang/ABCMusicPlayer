Team Contract
Emily Kellison-Linn, Caroline Morganti, Hailan Pang 

Goals
Do the best that we can (get an A)
Each team member contributes about evenly
Obstacles: time, meeting schedule conflicts, technical ability/limitation, interpersonal conflicts, conflicts with project design/vision 
As a team, we could decide to go for a B if restrained by time, etc. But one person cannot just give up and go for a B instead of an A. 
Ideally everyone would work nearly equally and for the same goal, but if one or two people really want to do more work, as long as everyone is meeting the baseline, the team members are free to do more if they want to - as long as it’s not getting in the way of other people’s work 

Meeting times
Lecture M, W, F
Tuesday recitation: Noon 
Thursday recitation; 1pm, and just continue working on past 2pm if we want/need to
Hannah is gone at conference Oct 24-26
Sunday OHs: 2-5pm 
We will try to come to all in-class/recitation times and work there. Class time will be used first to review work that we’ve completed, then to plan, and then to begin on new work if we have time.
We will probably meet quite a few times outside of class - scheduled Thursday afternoons, add as needed
Shared Google folder/docs will record all action items and minutes
DUE DATE: Oct 30

Work Norms
Anticipate probably 20 hours for each of the two weeks
Distribute work per milestone - at our meetings
Deadlines are set by when we meet and by the deadlines of the project
Task List is shared between all members in a Google doc - so we can all collaboratively record who is responsible, especially when meeting in person to set responsibilities 
If someone does not follow through, we will talk about it and make sure the next tasks are done. If someone is going through personal troubles and emergencies, we will discuss and figure it out
Work will be reviewed by the team members - either in person or at home
If people have different opinions about the quality of work, we can talk it out and figure out either compromises or if a baseline is met
Individual deadlines for ourselves and meeting team deadlines preferably earlier or at least on time

Decision-Making
Big decisions, probably yes. If we have trouble agreeing, ask TA  for advice, etc.
